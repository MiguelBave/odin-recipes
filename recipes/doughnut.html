        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Frying your own doughnuts is definitely a Power Grandma move. Using a can of biscuit dough makes it a project simple enough for anyone to tackle. </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 quarts oil for deep frying</li>
            <li>1 (10 ounce) can refrigerated buttermilk biscuit dough</li>
            <li>1 cup confectioners' sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). </li>
            <li>Separate out the biscuits and cut a hole in the middle of each one, like you would a doughnut. </li>
            <li>Carefully slide doughnuts into hot oil. Fry until golden brown on both sides. Drain briefly on wire racks placed over baking sheets. </li>
            <li>Place the confectioners' sugar in a bowl and roll the hot doughnuts in the sugar. </li>
        </ol>
